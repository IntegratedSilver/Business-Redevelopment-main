Peer Reviewers:  
---------------------
I see that your pages seem to be native 1080 p or also able to be 1440px wide so the pages fit well.  As we go smaller each page is responsive for almost everything.  For the index page I noticed that the p tags near the bottom bleeds into other containers as the screen gets smaller.  This seemed to be the only issue on the index page and no issues for any other page.  This was a great redo of the website you made.  I like the color palette and its simplicity, it makes everything feel more cohesive.
